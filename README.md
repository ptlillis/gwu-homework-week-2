this is an attempt at a responsive portfolio website for Peter Lillis
most elements were carried over from Bootstrap, with additional styling on a secondary CSS stylesheet
the pages are broken into columns, main content on the left and a sidebar on the right continuing onto each page

images for each page are linked in the git hub repository.

ultimately, this is not necessarily what i had in mind, but i am pleased that it is (largely) functional.
my biggest ongoing issue is ensuring the hamburger menue works upon moving to a smaller screen.

i will continue working on this project on my own time.
